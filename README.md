Movie Recommendation System
  
  Overview

This is a movie recommendation system that uses TF-IDF vectorization and cosine similarity to suggest movies based on a user's favourite movie. The system takes in a movie title as input and returns a list of similar movies.

  
  How it Works

Data Preprocessing: The system uses a dataset of movies and their corresponding features, such as genres, directors, and actors.
TF-IDF Vectorization: The system converts the movie features into TF-IDF vectors, which are used to calculate the similarity between movies.
Cosine Similarity: The system calculates the cosine similarity between the user's favourite movie and all other movies in the dataset.
Recommendation: The system returns a list of the top N similar movies to the user's favourite movie.
  
  Usage

Install Requirements: Install the required libraries by running pip install -r requirements.txt.
Run the System: Run the system by executing python movie_recommendation.py.
Enter Movie Title: Enter your favourite movie title when prompted.
Get Recommendations: The system will return a list of similar movies.
 
 Limitations

The system uses a simple recommendation algorithm and may not provide the most accurate results.
The system does not handle cases where the user's favourite movie is not found in the dataset.
  
  Future Improvements

Implement more advanced recommendation algorithms, such as collaborative filtering or content-based filtering.
Handle cases where the user's favourite movie is not found in the dataset.
Add more features to the dataset, such as movie ratings or reviews.
